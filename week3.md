## ðŸ§  Transformer Model Text Analysis

We implemented a transformer-based large language model (LLM) to analyze text and conversational data.  
This project provided hands-on experience with the architecture and inner workings of transformer models,  
while deepening our understanding of how LLMs process, interpret, and generate natural language.

**The goal:**  
To explore how transformer models operate and to gain practical experience in building, training, and applying an LLM to real-world text inputs.
