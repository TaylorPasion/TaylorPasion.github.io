## ðŸ§  Transformer Model Text Analysis

We implemented a transformer-based large language model (LLM) to analyze text and conversational data.  
This project provided hands-on experience with the architecture and inner workings of transformer models,  
while deepening our understanding of how LLMs process, interpret, and generate natural language.

**The goal:**  
To explore how transformer models operate and to gain practical experience in building, training, and applying an LLM to real-world text inputs.

### ðŸ”— Attention Mechanism

The image below shows an attention map, which visualizes how correlated each word is to the others in a sentence.  
This is a core mechanism in transformer modelsâ€”it allows the model to weigh the importance of each word relative to every other word.

### ðŸ’¬ Conversation Summarization

Below is an example of how the model was trained using real conversations.  
It shows how the transformer learns to summarize long text inputs into concise outputs.

## ðŸ“Š PokÃ©mon Stat Embedding Visualization

### ðŸ§¬ About the Plot

We created embeddings for PokÃ©mon based on core stats such as **HP**, **Attack**, **Defense**, and **Speed**. This data was pulled using a public PokÃ©mon API and visualized using a dimensionality reduction technique called **t-SNE**.

Unlike other projection methods that may impose artificial structure, **t-SNE** preserves the local relationships in the data, giving us a more authentic view of how PokÃ©mon compare based on their attributes.

Each point in the plot represents a single PokÃ©mon, and you can hover over each point to view its **types**, **abilities**, and **evolution line**.
