### ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection

#### What did you work on today and what did you learn?

<blockquote>
We continued exploring Pok√©mon data, focusing on analyzing relationships between typing and habitat. It helped us think about how environment and elemental traits might relate to each other across different Pok√©mon.
</blockquote>

#### What feedback did you get from your mentor today?

<blockquote>
Next week we will select a dataset and develop a research question. We‚Äôll then apply a neural network to analyze the data.
</blockquote>

#### Describe any challenges from today‚Äôs work that you need assistance with:

<blockquote>
One challenge was running the Jupyter Notebook efficiently. Since we‚Äôre importing a lot of data, setup and preprocessing took time before we could generate any graphs.
</blockquote>

#### Describe any information or support you may need to complete your work:

<blockquote>
None at this time.
</blockquote>

#### What will you be working on the next internship day?

<blockquote>
We will choose a question to investigate and begin training a neural network to analyze the dataset.
