## 🚀 Introduction to GitHub and Website Design

This week, I began building my personal website and learning version control with GitHub. Below are the key milestones from this process:

---

### 1️⃣ Picked a Jekyll Theme

I explored several Jekyll themes and selected one that fits my aesthetic and project goals.

</p>

### 2️⃣ Created My GitHub Site & Forked the Theme

I made my own GitHub repository and forked the Jekyll theme to serve as the foundation for my site.

### 4️⃣ Created a Weekly Project Page Layout

I organized project content into week-by-week blog posts/pages for clarity and tracking.

### 5️⃣ Started Coding in Jupyter Notebook

I began coding in Jupyter Notebook to run data analysis and test out visualizations for the internship projects.
